# CPSC 210 Personal Project

## Movie Rater & Organizer

An application that allows you to *add movies to a list*, in addition to their individual *genres* and *ratings*. 
This can be useful for movie critics to keep the movies they watch organized, or for personal use. 
This project is of interest of me, because I love watching movies but tend to forget which movies I have watched, 
and my rating of them!
